# A-new-Start
This is a new start of me coding and enhancing myself with new modern IT technologies.
<br>
I am going to learn several things in this coming 2 years until i get a job.
<br>
for starter i chose python and Java script for my future upgradation into AIML after completing Full stack Web dev.
<br>
In that journey i will also be learning about major and basic computer science skills and system design faundamentals to create a subtle way to make move towards Software if i ever choose to go so.
